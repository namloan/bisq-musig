# Single Transaction Protocol for Bisq

## Prelimery

### Goal

Currently, Bisq uses 4 transaction to make a normal trade. This causes a lot of fees, which in higher fee environment will get increasingly a problem. Also, these 4 transactions reveal the bitcoin script used for the
multisig. This is a limitation for privacy. The goal of this protocol is to reduce fees and have more privacy using Taproot.

### Paying fees

To keep this article short, I am omitting the problem of paying fees, as it can be added to the system quite easily afterward and doesn't have much of an impact.
There are different approaches to paying fees, obviously the easiest would be to just have another output in the transaction which pays the fees like it is done in the current model. But this approach
results in many small UTXOs. The discussion of fees is being moved to elsewhere.

## Trade protocol, happy path

Alice and Bob deposit their amounts into a 2of2 multisig.
Alice and Bob create random private keys, which are in no way connected to other private keys.
Note: In HD Wallets, which is the current standard, private keys are being derived from each other using a chaincode. So the sequence of private keys is deterministic.

For the alternative paths of this protocol, Alice and Bob need to prepare some pre-signed transactions. To do the signing process Alice and Bob use MuSig2 as Protocol.

A Schnorr based 2of2 multisignature, makes use of the additivity of the keys and their signatures. Instead of a script, we have a public key, which is a (weighted) sum of Alice and Bobs pub keys. The aggregated key locks
the
taproot transaction output in a key spend path.

The details of the MuSig2 protocol (and adaptive signatures) are [here](./MuSig2adaptor-rust.md) described in length.

The 2 public key from Alice and Bob can be combined to a aggregated public key.
> $P' := P_a + P_b$ \
> and the same for the corresponding private key \
> $p' := p_a + p_b$ \
> with the linearity of elliptic curves \
> $P' = p' \cdot G$

this effectively means, that when Alice passes her private key to Bob, he can calculate the private key for $P'$ and therefore has the private key for spending the multisig-output as he wants. So he has full control over
the UTXO.

So the Single transaction of the Bisq trade will have all outputs secured by a pay to public key hash and the transfer of ownership will be conducted by passing the private key from one person to the other. Note that the
SingleTx will have 2 outputs constructed like this, one output will be owned by the person which gets only the deposit back (the seller) and the other output will be owned by the buyer, which gets the trade amount and
the deposit.

Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the out-of-bands payment can begin. This is usually the fiat payment. Once the fiat payment is received, the Seller of BTC (Alice) will confirm the payment.
Alice sends her secret key $p_a$ to Bob. As stated earlier, the secret key must be generated independent of other secret keys. Modern HD Wallets have a dependency of secret keys among them and revealing a secret
key would reveal information about the other keys as well. This puts some burden on the wallet which can be used in this scenario. (Although random keys are not anything new to wallets, but the wallets needs
to keep track of a randomly created secret key.)

Bob now has both secret keys and can compute $p'$, therefore he has full control over the funds in the multisig transaction of the Bisq trade. Also, since he kept his secret key to himself, he knows that Alice can not
control the funds of the multisig. This basically puts him into the situation, that he doesn't need to make a new transaction to send the funds out of the multisig. Bob can leave the funds in the multisig and spent the
funds whenever and for whatever he wants, because he has the full private key to the funds and can sign any transaction with it.

### privacy

The happy path was constructed with privacy in mind. One taproot transaction with script-less multisigs. The transaction has 2 inputs and 4 outputs, which is not very typical, but also not uncommon.
However, it doesn't have a script based spending condition,
only normal key-spends. That still gives it a good privacy, as taproot transaction are very common nowadays.

### side note: use of normal segwit v0 transactions

If privacy would not be an issue, then the transaction for the happy path could be constructed differently. In that case, it could be made with segwit v0 as well. Instead of the scriptless multisig we could have a script
multisig. And instead of passing the private key to transfer the ownership of the scritless multisig, Bob could send a signature for his Public Key in the MultiSig. This Signature would need to have
`SIGHASH_NONE || SIGHASH_ALLCANPAY`. With this sighash type the signature will only verify against the own input, no output and no other inputs will be part of the message to check. Practically is this like a blank check
for the other side, it enables Alice to create any transaction, she just needs to sign her pub key in the multisig with her key. Alice must sign her pub key with `SIGHASH_ALL`. At least one Signature in a transaction
needs to have `SIGHASH_ALL`, otherwise the transaction could be changed by anybody seeing the transaction in the mempool, before its mined.

## Swap transaction

In the section 'Happy Path' I described only one part of the UTXO swap, basically the exchange of private keys. However, the seller deposits the trade amount and a deposit,
the buyer deposits only a deposit as
escrow. After the deal, the buyer should have control over a deposit and the buyer shall have sole control over the funds and a deposit, assuming the deposit from both parties have the same amount. This means they need
to exchange control for the respective utxos at the same time in an atomic way. If the seller sends the private key to the buyer, but the buyer stays inactive, then the seller will not get access to a deposit. The
deposit for him cannot be moved by anyone, because he still has one of two keys, but he cant move it either.
How do Alice and Bob exchange their private keys for the UTXOs in an atomic way?

Before exchanging the private key for $P'$ and $Q'$, Alice and Bob need to sign a swap transaction (`SwapTx`) for Alice (the Seller) in a way that when Alice uses the `SwapTx`, then she reveals
information to Bob such that he can spend Output 0 of the `DepositTx`, which is locked by $P'$. Bob constructs the `SwapTx` such that it sends the buyer (his) deposit to Alice Wallet.
Bobs prepares the signature for `SwapTx` such that Alice must reveal a secret to Bob to use that signature. Technically, this is done through adaptive signatures.
The secret Alice must pass to Bob for using the signature is $p_a$. Since Bob has $p_b$ already, that enables him to calculate $p' = p_a + p_b$,
which is the secret key for $P'$ so he can spend the sellers deposit and trade amount.

Details can be found in the [write-up of how adaptor signatures work with MuSig2](MuSig2adaptor-rust.md).
In sum this is a secret atomic UTXO swap. After preparing the `SwapTx`, Alice can send Bob the secret key $p_a$, if Bob doesn't send $p_b$, then she still has the `SwapTx` to use.
So Alice and Bob are able to exchange the keys without using a transaction, the `SwapTx` only serves as fallback if Bob doesn't follow the protocol.

The transfer of ownership in this protocol is basically swapping control of UTXOs, by exchanging private keys for the multisigs.

## the alternative paths, Warning Tx

However, sometimes one party is uncooperative or doesn't respond at all. For these cases we are preparing with pre-signed transactions. The first one is the Warning transaction. There is one transaction for
Alice and one for Bob. They are very similar, but not the same.

Here is how the `WarningTx Alice` would look like. It's called `WarningTx Alice`, because Alice can post it. Alice won't be able to post `WarningTx Bob`.
The inputs will be the two outputs of the SingleTx from above, which include the trade amount and both deposits.

Output 0:

- amount: Seller deposit and trade amount.
- Key spend: $P'$ In case that Alice has given Bob the 2nd secret key for $P'$ already, but still posting this `WarningTx Alice`,
  then Bob is able to immediately transfer the output 0 to his wallet by using the secret key for $P'$ as key spend.
  Note this should not happen, as it has only disadvantages for Alice.

Output 1: An anchor output with key spend from a public key of Alice Wallet. Since we are constructing the `WarningTx Alice` beforehand,
we won't know which is a reasonable fee rate at the time the transaction is broadcast. So Alice can construct a CPFP transaction to pay for additional fees.

### analysis of the alternative paths while swapping UTXOs

Above we saw the happy path, if everybody behaves as expected. Having those steps setup and explained, gives us now the possibility to analyse what can possibly go wrong.
Since swapping the UTXOs happens after initialization, all transactions seen in the diagram above are already setup and pre-signed. Even `SwapTx` is already signed,
which gives Alice the possibility of using it prematurely. If she uses it before the fiat payment actually happened, she can get Bob's deposit. But with exposing the signature for
`SwapTx` she enables Bob to get the trade amount and Alice deposit, which of course is a bad bargain. Only the Seller (Alice) has a `SwapTx`. Now what can happen while the UTXO swap:

1. If Bob is unresponsive at this step, Alice can post the `WarningTx Alice` and will get her money back (see below how exactly) or use the `SwapTx` to get her money directly (if the fiat transaction was successful).
2. If Alice is unresponsive, Bob can post the `WarningTx Bob`.
3. If Alice sees that the fiat payment arrived, Alice now begins with sending $p_a$ to Bob, which enables him to unlock the seller deposit and trade funds.
4. Bob can now spend $P'$ and don't care for sending Alice $q_b$ for her to get her deposit. Alice cannot send `WarningTX Alice` at this point,
   because Bob has already $P'$ and could get all funds out of `WarningTx Alice`.
    1. Alice can still use `SwapTx`to get her deposit.
    2. If Bob broadcasts his `WarningTx Bob` before Alice `SwapTx`, then Alice can still broadcast `RedirectTx Alice`, because Bob does not have the secret key for $Q'$ to empty `WarningTx Alice`.

## alternative Paths

After the `DepositTx` has been broadcast, it may happen for different reason, that the protocol does not move along the happy path described above.
It could be that one party is inactive or fiat payment didn't happen or any reason oe of the traders is not satisfied. In that case ech trader has the possibility to post a `WarningTx`.

### Warning transaction

The `WarningTx` has both outputs of the `DepositTx` as input, that means if any of the trader has spent his trade outcome already (and therefore the UTXO swap already happened), then the `WarningTx` cannot be used
anymore.
As the name says the `WarningTx` does warn the other party about what's ahead. One of three case can happen.

1. The `WarningTx Alice` has a key spend $S'$. If the key swap was successful beforehand then Bob has $p'=p_a+p_b$, the secret key for $P'$. He can take away all the money, both deposits and the trade amount.
   This is to prevent Alice using the `WarningTx` in case the happy path completed already.
2. `RedirectTx Bob`
3. `ClaimTx Alice`

### redirect transaction

The `RedirectTx Bob` has a time delay $t_1$ build in, which gives Bob some time to use Option 1 (the key spend). Note that we don't use a `OP_CSV` script,
because Alice enforces the time delay by not signing the `RediretTx Bob` if it doesn't have nSequence set to $t_1$. With the `RedirectTx Bob` Bob can send the funds to the
burning men of the Bisq DAO. With this option he can have an arbitrator look on the problems and reimburse the traders based on the case.
The `RedirectTx Bob` will have many outputs, distributing the money to all burning men of the DAO. Additionally, it has an anchor output with a pubkey of Bob, so he can CPFP the transaction to pay
for higher mining fees.

### claim transaction

The `ClaimTx Alice` has an even higher time delay $t_2$ with $t_2 > t_1$. This will send the funds to Alice. And will only happen if Bob fails to post his `RedirectTx Bob`, which means that he is inactive.
So for the case of inactive traders, the DAO doesn't need to provide arbitration and the other trader can claim both deposits and the trade amount.

## Advantages

- privacy. A lot of effort has been put into privacy for the users. The protocol is scriptless and only uses one transaction.
- The happy and alternative paths are scriptless. That means as opposed to current Bisq, from looking at the transaction on the blockchain you, you have only a small likelihood that the transaction is from Bisq.
- In the Bisq v1 system there is a time-based connection between
  the fiat payment and the pay-out transaction. Whereas in this protocol the transfer of ownership is done without transaction on the blockchain and therefore knowing the timing of the fiat payment doesn't
  help as much to find the corresponding bitcoin transaction.
- lower fees. The current Bisq trade needs 4 transactions, so the fees of this protocol are much lower.

## Disadvantages

- After the trade is successfully executed, Alice and Bob have their funds locked in P' and Q' respectively. They can send that at any time with any transaction they construct. However, the `WarningTx` can still be
  posted. This is unfortunate and not very comforting that someone, after the fact, can still post a valid transaction. Misuse of the `WarningTx` after the trade is over is not wise because
  if the other player detects it, then he can make a transaction to take all the money. So the offender will lose at least the deposit.

- To make normal use of the transferred funds, they should appear in the wallet. However, this may not work with each wallet. And may even need some custom wallet feature for handling this. Effectively that could mean
  that only the build-in wallet may handle this protocol.

## Conclusion

This protocol would provide a lot of on-chain privacy for bisq trades. The usability would increase, since the transfer of ownership is instant and does not need a transaction to be mined. The fees would considerably
decrease. This is at least for the happy path.
